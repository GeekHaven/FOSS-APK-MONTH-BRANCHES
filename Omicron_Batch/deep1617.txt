Hi iam deepanshu garg
My favorite senior from second year is Medha mam because she is so kind and explains everything to us with patience.
I never have that opportunity to interact with any third year seniors but till now every third year senior who come
to guide us is my favorite of all time.
Also i want to thank all the seniors who are a part of apk month to give us their precious time.
