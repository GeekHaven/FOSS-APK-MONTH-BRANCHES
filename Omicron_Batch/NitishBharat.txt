My favourite 3rd year senior is Ananya Ma'am because
1. She is very patient and explains nicely
2. She mentors us very well about entrepreneurship.
Special mention to Garvit Chitora sir.
PS:Not too much interaction with 3rd years senior.
My favourite 2nd year senior is Raghav sir because

2. He's very chill while interacting with his juniors.
special mention to Diya ma'am Her voice is so sweet
