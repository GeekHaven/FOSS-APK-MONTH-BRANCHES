My favourite 3rd year senior is Sanyam Agarwal
Till date I never came across a person with same name and here there are three people(me,my batchmate and sir)
with same name and surname,that is one hell of a coincidence. Kinda like Toby maguire, Andrew garfield and Tom 
Holland in same universe XDDD(dibs on Andrew) if he is ok with this stupidity  :-D

My favourite 2nd year senior is Divyansh Gupta 
1)He is my techfather and sir is super chill. Timepass karte hai and sir gyan bhi dete hai ЁЯШБ.
2)Abhi assignments,practicals bhi jo hai sir usme bhi help kara dete hai ЁЯШО.

Special mention for Raghav sir
