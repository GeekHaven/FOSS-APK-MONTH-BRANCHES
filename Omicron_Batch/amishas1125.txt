My favourite third year senior is Garvit Chittora sir because
1)He his in our HINT team and I find him quite knowledgeable and chill.
2)He is the overall head of Geekhaven and other technical events which is quite impressive.

My favourite second year senior is Diya Waghmare mam because
1)She seems very sweet and always helpful.
2)She is also in Geekhaven and is conducting our FOSS workshop which reflects that she is also quite knowledgeable.
