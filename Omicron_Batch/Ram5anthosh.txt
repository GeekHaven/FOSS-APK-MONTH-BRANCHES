I am really thankful to Suraj Sir from third year.
When I am not really sure of choosing a college after my JEE, 
He patiently cleared all my doubts about IIITA.

From second year, I can't point one specifically.
All of them, who ever I have spoken to have been very helpful.
Seniors from both cultural societies and technical societies have been really helpful.
Even in online mode they made sure that we won't miss anything.
