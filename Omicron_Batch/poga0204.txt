My favourite 3rd year senior is Garvit Chittora Sir because
1)He is also the overall coordinator of Geekhaven which I feel is really a big deal.
2)He is also very helpful and kind.
My favourite 2nd year senior is Raghav Goel Sir because
1)I have interacted with him the most and he seems really very knowledgeable.
2)He is really a very good orator and I really admire his speaking style.
