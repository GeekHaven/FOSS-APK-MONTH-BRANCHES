My favourite third year senior is Prince Sir because
1) He is the only 3rd year I have interacted with
2) I found him very chill in the chat. He sent me stickers as well.

My favourite second year senior is Ankit Sir because
1) Well, he is my tech parent. He has great humour.
2) He has given me the Drive Link to all the assignments.
