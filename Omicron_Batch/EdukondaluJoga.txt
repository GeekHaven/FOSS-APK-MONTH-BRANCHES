My favourite 3rd year is Manish sir
He helps me to attend spiritual class
And always asks about how the classes are going and asks do u have any problem in studying.
My favourite 2nd year is Kush sir
He always reply my questions very fast in discord
And he is so friendly and treat us like friends even though he is a senior
