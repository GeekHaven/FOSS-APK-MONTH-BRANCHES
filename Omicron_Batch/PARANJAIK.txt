ALL THE SENIORS OF IIIT ALLAHABAD ARE VERY SWEET AND HELPFUL. BUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF TASK:

> My favorite 3rd year senior is Sarthak Maheshwari Sir.
  1. He is very helpful in web operations.
  2. He is very polite and sweet.

> My favorite 2nd year senior is Diya Waghmare Mam.
  Because  
  1. I actually found her in almost all the societies and fests, i like her time management skills and she even does good participation.
  2. Secondly, she explains every single query raised very patiently, politely, and in an understandable manner.

> Actually all the 2nd year seniors are very helpful, they are teaching us everything very patiently keeping there work aside. From the
