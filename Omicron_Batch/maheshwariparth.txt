My favorite third year senior is Aditya Sir(Don't know surname) because
1. He was the first senior to interact with me and guided me for choosing IIIT A.
2. I have met him personally.
My favorite second year senior is Ishan Tapadiya Sir because
1. First second-year senior to interact with me and the only senior whose no. is saved on my phone.
2. Bade sahi lagte hai wo ;)
