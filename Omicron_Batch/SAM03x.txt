My favourite 2nd year seniors are Himanshu Bhawnani Sir and Mohan Agarwala Sir.
1)Himanshu sir seemed very helpful, he cleared my general doubts about societies and other things.
2)Mohan sir is my Techparent, he has been very helpful and is easy to interact with.

Sadly, I haven't interacted with any of the 3rd year seniors yet.
