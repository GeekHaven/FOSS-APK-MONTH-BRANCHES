My favourite third year senior is Garwit Sir because
1)He helped me when I made error in filling apk month form without asking a question.
2)...

My favourite second year senior is Raghav Sir + Aditya Verma sir because
1) Aditya Sir was feeling bad that everyone is writing Raghav sir's name
2) Sorry,Honestly, Both of them are really my favourites because we had a good informal conversation in Event and Management group(APK).
