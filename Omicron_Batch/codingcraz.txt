My favourite third year senior is Harsh Bharadwaj Sir because
1)He is the president of gymkhana so if he would know me then college mai mera bhi bhaukal hoga.
2)Secondly,I think he would have the power to call us to the hostels as soon as the situation of covid is under control.

My favourite second year senior is Khush Sir because
1)He is my tech parent and gives me best advices and helps me everytime.
2)He is very chill and I resonate with him a lot.
