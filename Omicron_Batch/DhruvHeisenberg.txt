My favourite third year senior is Harsh Bharadwaj Sir because
1)He is the president of gymkhana so if he would know me then college mai mera bhi bhaukal hoga.
2)Secondly,I think he would have the power to call us to the hostels as soon as the situation of covid is under control.

My favourite second year senior is Himanshu Bhawnani Sir because
1)Though he is not my tech parent but then also he gives me the best advices regarding everything related to the college.
2)He is very chill and I resonate with him a lot.
