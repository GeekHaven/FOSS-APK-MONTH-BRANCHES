My favourite third year senior is Ananya Agarwal because
1) She is very patient while she explains.
2) She has indepth knowledge of startups as she herself is working on one.
My favourite second year senior is Raghav Goel because
1) He is very helpful and patient while taking doubts.
2) I found him really chill in his way of interacting with juniors.
