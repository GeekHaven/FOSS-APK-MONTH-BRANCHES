My favourite third year senior is Garvit Chittora sir because
1) He seems to be quite knowledgable and smart
2) He is also a good leader because he is the OC of Geekhaven and is organising APK Month Workshops for juniors

My favourite second year senior is Raghav Goel sir because
1) He is good at anchoring orientations
2) He is a good FOSS teacher and did not tolerate my batchmates' spamming and scolded them well
