My favourite third year senior is Garvit Chittora Sir.
Firstly, because he is the overall coordinator of GeekHaven.
Secondly, because it was really good interacting with him and other third year seniors during HINT volunteer meets.

My favourite second year senior is Raghav Goel Sir.
Firstly, because he explained concepts really well during APK month class.
Secondly, found to be really chill during junior-senior interactions.
